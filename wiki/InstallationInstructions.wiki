js2-mode instructions

= Introduction =

js2-mode is a new JavaScript editing mode for GNU Emacs.  It aims to be more like an IDE (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ) than existing Emacs language modes.  There is a lot of work left to do to achieve this goal, but it's got a pretty good start:

   *  it offers the usual features from other Emacs modes
   * it has a real recursive-descent parser
   * it highlights syntax errors and underlines warnings
   * it supports collapsing function-body and block-comment definitions
   * it has some preliminary support for IMenu (to be improved soon)
   * it knows about jsdoc and highlights tags in jsdoc comments
   * it has a set of typing helpers to make editing easier

Most of the mode's features are customizable via M-x customize.

= Details =

To install js2-mode:

   * download the latest source distribution file, js2-XXXXXXXX.el
   * put it in your Emacs load-path somewhere as js2.el
   * in Emacs, M-x byte-compile-file RE js2.el RET
   * add these lines to your .emacs file:

{{{
(autoload 'js2-mode "js2" nil t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.js$" js2-mode))
}}}

It will refuse to run unless you have byte-compiled it.
You must byte-compile it with your version of Emacs because
different versions of Emacs have different byte-compiled formats.
