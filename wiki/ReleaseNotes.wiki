Release notes for new versions

=New for 20080401 release:=

  * fixed problem where indenting after line with /"/ regexp always indented to column 0.  It's still not perfect, but at least it invokes the bounce-indenter now.
    
  * fixed hitting Enter after /** in already-terminated block comment.  It was trying to terminate the comment again. Now it will only insert the terminator if it's currently a parse error (it assumes the error is an unterminated comment.)
    
  * added yield into the keyword lists (was inadvertently omitted)

  * per user request, made bounce-indent not record undo info

  * added highlighting for simple html start/end tags in jsdoc

  * don't do single-quote-matching inside comments, since typing an apostrophe is the most common case.
