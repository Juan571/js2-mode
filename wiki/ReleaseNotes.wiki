Release notes for new versions, in reverse-chronological order (most recent first)

=Release notes for April 1 2008, js2-20080401.el:=

  * fixed problem where indenting after line with /"/ regexp always indented to column 0.  It's still not perfect, but at least it invokes the bounce-indenter now.
    
  * fixed hitting Enter after /** in already-terminated block comment.  It was trying to terminate the comment again. Now it will only insert the terminator if it's currently a parse error (it assumes the error is an unterminated comment.)
    
  * added yield into the keyword lists (was inadvertently omitted)

  * per user request, made bounce-indent not record undo info

  * added highlighting for simple html start/end tags in jsdoc

  * don't do single-quote-matching inside comments, since typing an apostrophe is the most common case.

=Release notes for March 31 2008, js2-20080331.el:=

  * fixed broken installation instructions

  * added `js2-language-version` custom variable that defaults to 150, for JavaScript 1.5.  If you set it to 160, you get E4X support, and 170 adds let, yield, and array comprehensions.
    
  * added new warning for missing semicolon (auto-insertion)
     * configured via `js2-strict-missing-semi-warning`

  * fixed default indentation for first line of an object literal being passed as the first parameter to a function: most people want this indented from previous line, not from the curly-brace.  Example:
    
{{{
	foo.bar.baz({
          a: 1     // most people want this line indented here
}}}

  * improved the heuristics for deciding whether to insert a close-paren or close-bracket when sitting on one.  It's still not very smart, but it's less annoying than it was.
