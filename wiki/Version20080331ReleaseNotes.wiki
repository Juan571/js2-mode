Release notes for March 31 2008, js2-20080331.el:

  * fixed broken installation instructions

  * added `js2-language-version` custom variable that defaults to 150, for JavaScript 1.5.  If you set it to 160, you get E4X support, and 170 adds let, yield, and array comprehensions.
    
  * added new warning for missing semicolon (auto-insertion)
     * configured via `js2-strict-missing-semi-warning`

  * fixed default indentation for first line of an object literal being passed as the first parameter to a function: most people want this indented from previous line, not from the curly-brace.  Example:
    
{{{
	foo.bar.baz({
          a: 1     // most people want this line indented here
}}}

  * improved the heuristics for deciding whether to insert a close-paren or close-bracket when sitting on one.  It's still not very smart, but it's less annoying than it was.
